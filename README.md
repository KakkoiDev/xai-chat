# xAI Chat

A simple chat interface for xAI's API.

## Usage

1. Go to [kakkoidev.github.io/xai-chat](https://kakkoidev.github.io/xai-chat)
2. Enter your API key in the prompt
3. Start chatting

If you don't have an API key, you can get one from the [xAI console](https://console.x.ai/).

If you would like to user a different API key, you can do so by clicking the Options > UPDATE API KEY button.

## Features

1. Auto-save: The chat is auto-saved to local storage, so you can come back to it later.
2. Clear chat: The chat can be cleared by clicking the CLEAR CHAT button.
3. Update system message: The system message (the message that is sent to the API to set the behavior of the chat) can be updated by clicking the UPDATE SYSTEM MESSAGE button.
4. Update API key: The API key can be updated by clicking the UPDATE API KEY button.
5. Toggle streaming: The streaming (the feature that allows the chat to be streamed in real-time) can be toggled by clicking the STREAMING button.
6. Change temperature: Make the output more or less random by changing the temperature. 0 is the most deterministic, 2 is the most random.
